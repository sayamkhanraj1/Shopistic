                                           <p>Ah, the simplicity of bundling up in your finest knits when temps take a dip. While the art of layering can be a bit tricky to master for some, others know that taming the knit-wear-clad beast all comes down to a really, really good sweater as your base. From there, you can layer to your heart's content with a shacket, peacoat, scarf, and whatever else fits your mood. So whether you're a turtleneck fanatic or can't help but purchase yet another balloon sleeve crewneck, the perfect piece of knitwear is out there for you. And lucky enough for you, it can arrive on your doorstep within two days, thanks to a little website you might know called Amazon, which is bursting with hidden winter clothing gems within all kinds of price ranges.

Ahead, we found the best sweaters under $50 that reviewers couldn't get their hands on fast enough. Here's to a cozier future.</p>

&nbsp;<strong>What:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Adidas for Prada Re-Nylon collection <br />

<strong>Why:</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp; Prada and Adidas are kicking off 2022 with a collaboration that bears in mind the future of our planet. The Adidas for Prada Re-Nylon collection, named after Prada’s Re-Nylon fabric reimagined within the iconic Adidas Originals Forum, features high-end athletic wear (think: RTW, accessories, bags, and elevated takes on classic Adidas Forum High and Low silhouettes) made in Italy with recyclable materials. In tandem with the drop, there will be a celebratory digital activation, bringing both brands and customers together in the metaverse (where else?). The inherently innovative spirit of this latest collection has a unique rollout fitted for the future of fashion, all the while emphasizing sustainability.</p>
