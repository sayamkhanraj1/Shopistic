                                    <p> <strong>Who:</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp; Prada and Adidas <br />

&nbsp;<strong>What:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Adidas for Prada Re-Nylon collection <br />

<strong>Where:</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp; Jan. 13 at Prada boutiques worldwide and online at prada.com and adidas.com/prada <br />

<strong>Why:</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp; Prada and Adidas are kicking off 2022 with a collaboration that bears in mind the future of our planet. The Adidas for Prada Re-Nylon collection, named after Pradaâ€™s Re-Nylon fabric reimagined within the iconic Adidas Originals Forum, features high-end athletic wear (think: RTW, accessories, bags, and elevated takes on classic Adidas Forum High and Low silhouettes) made in Italy with recyclable materials. In tandem with the drop, there will be a celebratory digital activation, bringing both brands and customers together in the metaverse (where else?). The inherently innovative spirit of this latest collection has a unique rollout fitted for the future of fashion, all the while emphasizing sustainability.</p>
